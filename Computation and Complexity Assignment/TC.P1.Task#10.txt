After reading over the specifications for this phase and reviewing the code and the outputs, task 3 has been completed as there is key uniqueness because if the same key that is already in the input file is inserted into the command line, then the code recognizes the duplicate and return an output error message as such. Moreover, task 4 was completed since regardless of the order of attributes (first name, last name, boolean of lives in New York, phone number id, input file, and output file) the output is the same. For example, in task 4, after running Steve Smith's information multiple times in various orders for those three trials, the first trial being the original order, the output for all fo them was the same, indicating that Steve sMith's phone number id was already in the input file and such they all returned the duplicate error. For task 5 and 6, the code necessary to complete the tasks was provided in the Membership.java file and in the MemberInfo.java file, which includes the objects of each and the hashtable data structure. For task 7, the extra output switch was added indicating that all the members wanted to be printed (outputAllMembers=true) and the output showed as such, however for task 8, I did notice some bugs when changing that switch to false resulted in some expected behavior on some test runs. However, when removing this flag and entering the command into the terminal, the output file adds the singular member output file correctly and saves it. There are some corrections to be done with that flag in terms of task 8. What I think is causing the problem is the printMemberInfo() method with the if statements and the else if statement. I debugged it and tested various options, and this method is definitely affecting that output and the completion of that task. As for task 9, persistence is shown in the code and is explained in the text file for task 9.
