Persistence refers to the characteristic of a state that outlives the process that created it, meaning that the state is stored in a manner that it can be recovered or accessed at a later time, even after the system that created it has been executed and was turned off or ceased to exist. Persistence is an important aspect since it ensures that the state, user data, or other information between sessions is maintained and saved. Without persistence, the information would be lost as soon as the application is closed. The code for this project demonstrates persistence in a Java application through reading from and writing to external files. The method readInitialDataFile() allows the user to read the member information from a file, which is specified by the inputFileName and the initial data about the members gets loaded up into the membershipDatabase map. This process ensures that any data previously saved is available when the program starts. This demonstrates persistence by recovering the previous state. Moreover, we write data to a file, which is specified by outputFileName, with the method printMemberInfo(). By writing this information to an external file, the program ensures that the current state of memberDatabase can be saved and accessed later, even after the program has been terminated. This is another key aspect of persistence, where we can store the data in an output file, or even a database, where we load it back up from each time we want to retrieve that data at that state. For example, writing to an output file ensures that data is written onto a storage device like a hard drive, which does not need continuous power to keep the data intact.
